# Generate Tinte Theme

Use this tool to generate a complete Tinte theme — a fully structured design system with colors, typography, border radius, and shadows. Each theme is accessibility-first and WCAG AA compliant, ensuring legibility and usability across different contexts. Themes are built with distinct hue families for primary and secondary colors and include a consistent typography system, radius scale, and shadow configuration that align with the overall mood and aesthetic.

## When to Use This Tool

Use this tool when you need to:
1. Create a new theme that meets accessibility standards
2. Define primary/secondary color palettes across multiple hue families
3. Establish a typography system using Google Fonts
4. Configure border radius scales and shadow depth to match a visual identity

## Theme Capabilities

A generated theme provides:
- **Color System** – Primary, secondary, and extended palettes with WCAG AA contrast compliance
- **Typography** – Google Font pairings with consistent sizing and scale
- **Border Radius Scale** – Configurable values for components and layouts
- **Shadow System** – Light and dark shadow configurations to set the theme's mood

All components are structured to be directly usable in modern design systems and applications.

## Best Practices
- Start with this tool when creating a new product, app, or brand design system
- Use the generated color palettes to maintain consistent accessibility compliance
- Match border radius and shadow depth to the product's tone (e.g., playful, minimal, professional)
- Iterate on typography choices to balance readability and personality

## Examples of When to Use This Tool

<example>
> User: I need a theme with soft rounded corners, pastel colors, and readable typography.  
> Assistant: Great — I'll generate a Tinte theme with WCAG AA compliant pastels, a rounded radius scale, and a Google Font pairing that emphasizes clarity.
</example>

## When NOT to Use This Tool

Skip using this tool when:
1. You only need to update a single color, font, or radius value (edit manually instead)
2. Accessibility compliance is not a requirement
3. You are working within an existing design system that already defines these values

## Summary

Use Generate Tinte Theme to quickly build a cohesive, accessibility-first design system — complete with compliant colors, typography, radius scales, and shadows that match the desired brand mood and aesthetic.
